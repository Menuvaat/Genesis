To quickly configure NeoVim for coding run the following commands:


Arch Linux:
  1: sudo pacman -Syu neovim git base-devel cmake clang gcc
  2: git clone https://github.com/LazyVim/starter ~/.config/nvim
  3: rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
  4: nvim 
  5: Wait until LazyVim is installed (automatically), then EVERYTHING's set, enjoy!

Debian/Ubuntu:
  1: sudo apt install neovim git build-essential cmake clang gcc
  2: The rest is the same as in Arch Linux, follow the Arch instructions from now on. Continue in Nº2!
